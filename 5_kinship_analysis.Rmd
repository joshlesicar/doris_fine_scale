# Kinship Analysis

## Tools & manuals  
*vcftools* v0.1.16 [manual.](https://vcftools.github.io/man_latest.html)  

## Kinship dataset

### Removal of unrelated individuals  
Individuals that were found to genetically differ from the majority in the Palmer Archipelago were excluded from the kinship dataset. This was determined using structure and a PCA.  

Firstly, the ```PAL.keep``` file was duplicated, and a list of individuals exlcuded to prodice ```KINSHIP.keep```.   

Individuals excluded:
RNO2_L0056
RNO2_L0062
RNO2_L0139
RNO2_L0141
RNO2_L0142
RNO2_L0145
RNO2_L0148
RNO2_L0158
RNO2_L0160
RNO2_L0163
RNO2_L0164

As this kinship dataset comprised a new configuration of individuals, population specific SNP filtering was applied.  

### Remove sites by missingness  

Site missingness was calculated using vcftools v0.1.16 functions --keep and --missing-site.

```
vcftools --vcf biallelic_sites.recode.vcf --keep localities/KINSHIP.keep --missing-site --out KINSHIP
```  

#Sites to remove for PAL data set

As kinship analysis is sensitive to call rate, and missingness is very low, the most strignet filter was applied: sites with any missingness to be excluded.  

```  
awk 'NR > 1 && $6 > 0 { print $1, $2 }' KINSHIP.lmiss > badsitesKINSHIP.txt
```  

A VCF file for just kinship individuals was then created.  

```
vcftools --vcf biallelic_sites.recode.vcf --keep localities/KINSHIP.keep --recode --recode-INFO-all --out KINSHIP_initial
```  

Sites with any missingness were then removed.  

```
vcftools --vcf KINSHIP_initial.recode.vcf --exclude-positions badsitesKINSHIP.txt --recode --recode-INFO-all --out KINSHIP_CR1
```

After filtering, kept 72463 out of a possible 73993 Sites.  

### Filter by maximum observed heterozygosity  
Filtered by a maximum observed heterozygosity of 0.7 (in line with https://esj-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/1438-390X.12192).  

```
Required R packages:  
#install.packages("adegenet")
#install.packages("vcfR")
library(adegenet)
library(vcfR)

#calculating site heterozygosity for fine scale dispersal data  

#import vcf file into R
vcf_kinship <- read.vcfR("KINSHIP_CR1.recode.vcf")
#convert vcf data into a genind object
kinship_genind <- vcfR2genind(vcf_kinship)
#summary statistics
summary_kinship = summary(kinship_genind)
summary_kinship$Hobs
#export site heterozygosity into a csv file
write.csv(summary_kinship$Hobs, file = "kinship_Hobs_per_SNP.csv")
```  

Sites with a heterozygosity â‰¥ 0.7 can now be removed.  

```
vcftools --vcf KINSHIP_CR1.recode.vcf --exclude-positions kinship_bad_SNPs.txt --recode --recode-INFO-all --out KINSHIP_max_het07
```

After filtering, kept 66045 out of a possible 72463 Sites

### Filter by MAF  
```
vcftools --vcf KINSHIP_max_het07.recode.vcf --maf 0.3 --recode --recode-INFO-all --out KINSHIP_maf03
```  
After filtering, kept 2514 out of a possible 66045 Sites.  

### Select one SNP per locus
```
vcftools --vcf KINSHIP_maf03.recode.vcf --thin 500 --recode --recode-INFO-all --out KINSHIP_SNPs
```  
After filtering, kept 1646 out of a possible 2514 Sites.  

##Kinship Analysis  

###Sequoia

First the VCF file will be converted into a .RAW file that can be interpreted by Sequoia. 

```
#convert vcf file to plink
#plink --vcf KINSHIP_SNPs.recode.vcf --allow-extra-chr --recode --out KINSHIP_SNPs
#extract data from plink file
#plink --file KINSHIP_SNPs --allow-extra-chr --recodeA --out sequoia_KINSHIP_SNPs
```  

Sequoia was then run 

###MCMC-ped

I need to transfrom my .vcf file into .tped format. This can be done with plink.

```
plink --vcf KINSHIP_SNPs.recode.vcf --allow-extra-chr --make-bed --out MCMC_KINSHIP_BINARY
plink --bfile MCMC_KINSHIP_BINARY --allow-extra-chr --recode transpose --out MCMC_KINSHIP
```

Recode column 3 and 4 to 0 as genetic distance and physical distance is both unknown for ddRADseq data.

```
awk '{$3 = 0; $4 = 0; OFS=" "; print}' input.tped > output.tped
```
